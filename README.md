# A Turtle Made It To The Water!
Based on the World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth world quest "The cycle of life" (and accompanying meme), "A turtle made it to the water!" is a simplistic arcade game where the goal is to eat as many of the oncoming turtles as possible whilst dodging spells from those pesky adventurers.

Designed for the LaFortuna AVR board.

Uses Klaus-Peter Zauner's COMP2215 task 1 skeleton code (University of Soutmapton) as a basis for main.c, Steve Gunn's lcd, led and rotary libraries, and platelminto's buttons.c and buttons.h files to get the buttons to work.
